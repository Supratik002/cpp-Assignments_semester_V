typedef int (&rifii)(int, int);

/*   is a "typedef" that defines "rifii" as an alias for a *reference to a function* that takes two int arguments and returns an int.*/


/* Why do we use a Reference to a Function?*/
/*1. *Efficiency*: Using a reference to a function avoids copying function pointers and ensures that the function reference always points to the same function.
2. *Readability*: Using "typedef" makes the code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with complex function signatures.
This can be particularly useful in scenarios where functions are passed as arguments (e.g., in callbacks, functional programming patterns, or implementing strategies).
